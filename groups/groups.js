/*Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). 
Like Set, it has add, delete, and has methods. Its constructor creates an empty group,
add adds a value to the group (but only if it isnâ€™t already a member),
delete removes its argument from the group (if it was a member),
and has returns a Boolean value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.*/
